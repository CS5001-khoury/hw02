* Student: YOUR NAME
* Semester: SEMESTER

## Common

* List any coding practice problems you completed, feel free to comment at needed (did it help, was it too easy, etc):

* List any other resources you used to help you complete the assignment (make sure to share good ones to the Tips,Tricks, and Resources channel in teams!):
  

## Module Specific
For all these questions, it is recommended you open up IDLE or the python interpreter and try out the code.  You can also use the python visualizer to help you visualize the code.  You can find the visualizer here: [http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)




## Deeper Thinking

 For star_rating and hobby_card, we built strings and then printed out the results. Why would we want to build strings, and then print out the results, than just printing out the results directly? Don't need a correct answer, but we encourage you to ponder this question and come up with reasons on why this would be a good design pattern.  Write your answer below.
